# RayTracing
A ray tracer producing a tiff image file

TiffLib should be included in project file for this program to work. This library is used for creating a tiff image
out of RGB array created by ray tracing.


NOTES on program:

Should be modified to read any ".prop" file. Right now its being developed for only a specific case, which includes only 1 
triangle, 1 sphere and 1 plane. Purpose of this software was to create an image, not to create a generic software.
